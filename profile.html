         <h3>Project</h3>
        <ul><h4>Acadammic Project</h4>
        <li><h5 class="title">
            Smart Farming Based Deep Learning Approach For Guava Fruite Disease Detection.
        </h5>
    <p class="project_title">Developed a deep learning-based image classification system to detect and classify three types of guava fruit diseases using a custom dataset.

Collected and preprocessed guava leaf images using a smartphone under varied lighting and angles for model training.

Implemented a fine-tuned VGG19 convolutional neural network using transfer learning, achieving over 90% classification accuracy.

Compared VGG19 performance with a Random Forest classifier using handcrafted features for benchmarking.

Designed the project to support real-time disease identification, aiding farmers in early intervention and crop health management.

Prepared a detailed research paper in IEEE format, including dataset samples, model performance graphs, and evaluation metrics.</p>
